# About this project

This is a derivative project from:

https://github.com/dotnwat/k8s-vagrant-libvirt 

Includes a Portworx deployment on a 3 worker node cluster and 1 master node.

It creates 3 virtual disks per worker node. Uses 6GB of RAM per node, I would recommend to have at least 32GB of RAM on your host.

Portworx pods will take up to 10 minutes to become ready.
